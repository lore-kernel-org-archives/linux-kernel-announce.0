Hi Andrew and all others,
1. The floppy bug does not exist anymore. Congretulations!
My IDE hardware is Intel north and south bridge, the standard idecd dri=
ver is in use.
As I was all the time suspecting a timing error I'm looking forward to =
testing Mike=C2=B4s patch and I guess the bug will be absent then.
Lots of thanks for Mikes work!
Big regards and thanks for the late reply

Uwe
